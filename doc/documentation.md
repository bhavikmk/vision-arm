## Vision based dynamic obstacle avoidance for redundant manipulator

### Description

Development of vision based dynamic obstacle avidance for redundant manipulator (7 DOF)

### Requirements

Coming soon....

### Method

1. Working with RGB and depth image directly
2. Converting RGBD to Pointcloud and then use it

Note: RGBD Camera is static 

### Flowchart

Coming soon....

<!-- ### Hardware and software requirements

**Sensors**
>   * RGBD camera
>   * Motor encoders

**Actuators**
>   * Servo motors / Stepper Motors with ratings as per requirement

**Software**
>   * ROS Noetic (Ubuntu 20.04) -->

<!-- TODO:
- [ ] Take goal positions 
- [ ] Path planning and obstacle avoidance in single node and send desired joint positions to joint position controller
- [ ] Interface with moveit  -->
