## Vision based dynamic obstacle avoidance for redundant manipulator

### Problem statement

Development of vision based dynamic obstacle avidance for redundant manipulator (7 DOF)

### Project description

Collaborative robots, or cobots, are the more accessible descendants of traditional industrial robots and are designed to work alongside humans. There are many collaborative robot applications across all industries. These include assembly, dispensing, finishing, machine tending, material handling, welding, material removal, quality inspections, and more. Cobots enable effective and safe collaboration between humans and machines. These human-robot teams boost productivity, drive higher quality and often offer better value for investment than fully automated solutions.
